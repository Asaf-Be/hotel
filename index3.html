               <h2 class="h2-story">Where it all begins?</h2>
               <p class="p-story">Well it all started back in period of Austro-Hungarian empire. 
                   One of the richest man in Sarajevo during that time, always loved mountains and nature
                Everyday he liked to walked there and hiking. Impressed with untouched beauty of nature near his home town, he had idea.
               Why wouldn't he build hotel there? 
               Place with cheapest prices that all people from his town and country could enjoy. Hotel that will provide a lot of
               services. Someplace that all Bosnians and all Herzegowinians could afford.
                It took one year to deal with "paperology". And voila - building started.
               He personaly visited construction site everyday paying attention to every detail. 
               And after another year hotel is there. Finished. Opening day was on March 15th 1886. 
               There were a lot people on grand opening. Rumours said there were thousands.
               During period of Yugoslavia, our hotel was most visited destination in whole country. 
               A lot of touristic awards was won. Unfortunately,
               during war in 90s hotel was completely destroyed. 
               But in late 90s with a lot of help from whole sides of the world, hotel was reconstructed.
               Second grand opening was at 19th Juny 1999. And there weren't any rumours - on that day literally thousands of people attended second grand opening.
               Now, our hotel is one of the Balkan's top destionation.
                We have visitors from all around the world. South America, North America, Europe, Asia, Australia.
               We would be happy if you visit us and enjoy perfect natural experience. And after all these years we kept same vision as our founder. Keeping it available 
               for everyone. Cheapest prices and unique experience for everyone.</p>
